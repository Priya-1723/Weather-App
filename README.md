Weather App 
This weather app project provides real-time weather information by fetching data from the OpenWeatherMap API. The app allows users to search for a city, retrieve the weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions (e.g., clear sky, rain, snow, etc.), and display them in an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
